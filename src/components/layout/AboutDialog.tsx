          üõ°Ô∏è Your PDFs Stay Private
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          When you use Merge PDF, your documents never leave your computer. Everything happens right in your browser,
          so your sensitive documents aren't uploaded to any servers. It's like having a PDF workshop right on your own device!

          Unlike many online services, we don't store copies of your files or require you to create an account.
          Your documents remain completely in your control from start to finish.

          ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          This tool uses JavaScript running in your web browser to combine your PDF files.
          Think of it as having a PDF toolkit that runs locally - no internet connection is needed for processing once the page loads.
